# Cozy Astro 🏝️

A fun evening learning exercise exploring how Astro Islands built with different frameworks (Svelte, React, Vue, SolidJS) can communicate with each other.

🌐 **[Live Demo](https://cozy-astro.madeby.dev)**

## 🎯 Project Goals

This project was created as a hands-on experiment to:
- Learn Astro's Islands architecture
- Test inter-framework communication between islands
- Explore how different UI frameworks can coexist in a single application

## 🛠️ Tech Stack

- **[Astro](https://astro.build)** - Static site builder with Islands architecture
- **[Svelte](https://svelte.dev)** - Reactive UI framework
- **[React](https://react.dev)** - Component-based UI library
- **[Vue](https://vuejs.org)** - Progressive JavaScript framework
- **[SolidJS](https://www.solidjs.com)** - Reactive UI library
- **TypeScript** - Type-safe JavaScript

## 🎨 Creative Tools Used

# Build for production
npm run build

# Preview production build
npm run preview
```

## 🏗️ Astro Islands Architecture

Astro Islands allow you to use multiple UI frameworks in the same project. Each island is an isolated, interactive component that can be hydrated independently, leading to better performance and flexibility.

This project demonstrates communication patterns between islands built with different frameworks, showcasing the interoperability of modern web technologies.
